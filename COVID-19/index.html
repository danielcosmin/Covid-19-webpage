                                        cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is caused also by certain other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more
                                        lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines
                                        or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.They are enveloped
                                        viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.They
                                        have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.</p>

                                        <strong>Symptoms</strong> of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic. The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent). Less common symptoms
                                        include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell (initially estimated at 30 per cent but later at only 15 per cent, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache,
                                        chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, and diarrhea.</p>

                                    <p class="textinfo">
                                        <strong>WHO</strong> and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say it is primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced when people cough, sneeze or talk; with close contact
                                        being within approximately 1–2 m.Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.An article published in March 2020 argued that advice on droplet distance might be based on 1930s research which ignored the effects of warm moist exhaled air surrounding the droplets
                                        and that an uncovered cough or sneeze can travel up to 8.2 metres. These droplets may also be produced during breathing; however, they rapidly fall to the ground or surfaces and are not generally spread through
                                        the air over large distances.The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) suggested on 1 April that bioaerosol transmission may be possible. In one study cited by the NAS experts, air collectors positioned in the hallway
                                        outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Some medical procedures such as intubation
                                        and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in an airborne spread. Initial studies suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7
                                        days and a basic reproduction number (R0 ) of 2.2–2.7, but a study published on April 7, 2020, calculated a much higher median R0 value of 5.7 in Wuhan. It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface,
                                        known as fomite transmission, and then touches one's eyes, nose or mouth. While there are concerns it may spread via faeces, this risk is believed to be low.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says
                                        while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two or three others. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.</p>

                                                    met almost every day since it was assembled. Task force meetings usually last

                                                    briefing. But given there was no briefing this weekend, the meeting Saturday

                                        <p class="card-text">As the coronavirus pandemic has spread around the world, with millions infected and thousands dead, billionaire Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has pledged a
                                            <span class="text1">quarter billion dollars to combat the disease through his
                                                    foundation. Gates has been an advocate for pandemic preparedness for years, and
                                                    his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is contributing financing to several
                                                    coronavirus vaccine initiatives. He famously gave a 2015 TED talk warning of the
                                                    potential devastation caused by — and urged readiness for — a worldwide
                                                    pandemic.Those factors are behind bizarre new conspiracy theories that claim
                                                    Gates is responsible for the coronavirus pandemic and have rapidly spread from
                                                    fringe conspiracy theorists online to conservative pundits.

                                        <p class="card-text">Germans have started wearing facemasks outside the home as new rules come into force to curb the spread of coronavirus.<span class="text1">The
                                                use of cloth masks is now mandatory on public transport and, in most regions,
                                                within shops. The rules vary among the 16 German states - Bavaria being the
                                                strictest, while in Berlin shoppers do not have to wear masks. But the
                                                authorities are moving very cautiously in easing the lockdown. Across the world
                                                countries are coming up with their own guidance on mask-wearing. However, the
                                                World Health Organization (WHO) advice suggests people should wear protective
                                                masks only if they are sick and showing symptoms, or if they are caring for
                                                people suspected to have Covid-19.It says masks are not recommended for the
                                                general public because they can be contaminated by coughs and sneezes, and might
                                                offer a false sense of security.</span>

                                                can do this!" he cheered in another. The billionaire entrepreneur is the driving
                                                force behind a widespread operation to ship medical supplies to more than 150
                                                countries so far, sending face masks and ventilators to many places that have
                                                been elbowed out of the global brawl over life-saving equipment.But Ma's critics

                                                this bold venture into global philanthropy unveiled him as the friendly face of
                                                China's Communist Party? Or is he an independent player who is being used by the
                                                Party for propaganda purposes? He appears to be following China's diplomatic
                                                rules, particularly when choosing which countries should benefit from his
                                                donations, but his growing clout might put him in the crosshairs of the jealous
                                                leaders at the top of China's political pyramid.</span>

                                                is a coronavirus vaccine important? The virus spreads easily and the majority of
                                                the world's population is still vulnerable to it. A vaccine would provide some
                                                protection by training people's immune systems to fight the virus so they should
                                                not become sick. This would allow lockdowns to be lifted more safely, and social
                                                distancing to be relaxed. What sort of progress is being made?Research is
                                                happening at breakneck speed. About 80 groups around the world are researching
                                                vaccines and some are now entering clinical trials.The first human trial for a
                                                vaccine was announced last month by scientists in Seattle. Unusually, they are
